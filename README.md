## About
JSON crawler. Sends asynchronous requests simulating endpoint actions. Pulls and compares json differences side by side.

## Genesis
Working in divided team of IT specialist made me realise how important communication is. Sadly it's always a problem. I needed a notification tool to help me compare endpoint changes side by side, preferably with some kind of notification system.

## Technologies
jQuery, bootstrap, bootflat, iCheck, ajax calls, HTML5 + css.
